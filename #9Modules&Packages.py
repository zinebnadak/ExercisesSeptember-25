#1 Write a module you can use for playing the game: "Rock","papper", "scissors".
#The module will have two functions:
# The first will randomly return one of the above values every time you replay
# The second function will have two texts as parameters.
# These texts will contain one of the three values that the first function returns.
# This function will determine who won or if it got equal

#You're not writing a full game loop here â€” just the logic that can be used inside a game.

#2 The game is played by receiving one card at a time, and the player decides whether to take additional cards or not.
# The goal is to get the total card value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
# Aces are counted as either 1 or 14.
# If a player exceeds 21, they lose. In this example, a game is simulated between a human player and the computer.
# One card is dealt at a time, and after each round, if the player or the computer ends up with more than 21 points, they are considered to have lost.
# If both the player and the computer have less than 21 points, the one with the higher score wins.
# The computer always wins in case of a tie.
